      "My wife and I moved to Post Falls from southern Utah. We leased a home here for about 1 year to allow us time to become familiar with the area and the contractors. Our search was quite extensive. We had plenty of time for our research of contractors, sub contractors and housing developments. AllBuilt Homes was the perfect fit for us. The owner of the company, Vitalli was wonderful to work with. He has a great group of subcontractors and Vitalli always makes himself available I found that comforting making the entire process seamless. Allbuilt Homes is the construction company a person hopes they can find, but far to often find they need to settle for something less. Hiring Vitalli and his company AllBuilt Homes you find you are getting more than just another general contractor, you will be gaining a new friend who is fair and extremely honest in his dealings and will always make himself available to you long after the project is complete. I highly recommend Vitalli and his company AllBuilt Homes to anyone looking for a quality, honest and trustworthy builder for any construction project.",
